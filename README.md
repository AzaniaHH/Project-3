 # Project Proposal: Mental Health in a Remote World: A Data-Driven Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the impact of remote work on mental health using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The focus will be on understanding how various factors, such as job role, work location, and stress levels, influence employees' mental well-being. Through data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, we will derive insights that can help organizations better support their remote workforce.

## Objectives
1. **Identify trends in mental health conditions across different job roles.**
2. **Examine the relationship between work-life balance and work location.**
3. **Analyze how stress levels affect productivity changes among employees.**

## Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is available on Kaggle: [Remote Work and Mental Health](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/remote-work-and-mental-health).

## Visualizations

### 1. Mental Health Condition by Job Role
- **Type**: Bar chart
- **Library**: Plotly
- **Interaction**: Dropdown to filter by specific job roles.
- **Description**: This visualization will display the distribution of mental health conditions (e.g., anxiety, depression) across various job roles. Users can select specific roles from a dropdown menu to focus on the mental health challenges faced by employees in those positions.

### 2. Work-Life Balance vs. Work Location
- **Type**: Box plot
- **Library**: hvplot or Matplotlib
- **Interaction**: Users can select specific work locations to view.
- **Description**: This box plot will illustrate the work-life balance ratings across different work locations (remote, hybrid, onsite). By allowing users to filter by location, we can identify trends and disparities in work-life balance perceptions.

### 3. Stress Levels and Productivity Change
- **Type**: Scatter plot with trend line
- **Library**: Plotly
- **Interaction**: Allow users to filter by age group or gender.
- **Description**: This scatter plot will showcase the correlation between stress levels and changes in productivity. Users will be able to filter the data by age group or gender to uncover insights about how these demographics experience stress and its impact on their work performance.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: The dataset will undergo cleaning to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and convert data types.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Initial analysis will be performed to understand data distributions and relationships between variables.
3. **Visualization Development**: Interactive visualizations will be created using Plotly and hvplot or Matplotlib to facilitate user engagement and insights.

## Ethical Considerations
We will ensure that all data handling and analysis uphold ethical standards. This includes maintaining privacy and confidentiality for any identifiable information and being mindful of how our findings could impact perceptions of mental health in the workplace.
